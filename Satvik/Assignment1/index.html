            It was a day to forget for Tottenham Hotspur, who dropped not only the opening match of the season, but their first home match as well, losing 1-0 to Everton on Sunday. Spurs looked listless and exhausted by the end of the match, and lacked any sort of spark that could’ve seen them complete the comeback to at least earn a draw.
            <p>After the match, Mourinho said “Look Harry Kane trained with us once. Just once. One day. Moussa Sissoko just a couple. I’m not going player by player but for different reasons our players they didn’t have that proper pre-season.

                “We had cases of positive COVID-19. Of course we have the right to say which players they were, but we had players with positive COVID. We had other players in quarantine due to proximity with the positive players. We had a player in quarantine [Kane] because he was on holiday in a country that England demands quarantine."</p></div>

            The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.</p>

            <p>As a Chelsea fan, delighted with an opening win to the season but let's be honest, it was slow and sluggish. Not the debut I'd hoped for from Havertz who will need to pick up the intensity to keep a place in the eleven. Werner on the other hand, worked his socks off and a class act.</p>

        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">Arsenal off to a flying start</span><p><span class="headline hl4">by David Amoyal</span></p></div>The Arsenal rebuild is still far from complete, but new signings Willian and Gabriel already look at home. As opening days go, this jaunt to south-west London could not have gone better for Mikel Arteta as Arsenal won 3-0 at Fulham in their first game of the 2020-21 season.</p>

            <p><span class="citation">"I knew Willian would put in a performance like that straight away"</span> The three goals were perfect representations of Arteta's style: the first down to graft and determination, set-piece precision for the second and for the third, finding space, pulling the opposition out of position and capping it off with a wondrous finish.</p>
            <p>As opening days go, this was perfect for Arteta, but with time remaining in the transfer window, there will be more departures, but any movement cannot destabilise this system</p></div>
        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">American consortium to step up efforts to buy West Ham</span><p><span class="headline hl4">by Christain Falk</span></p></div><p>An American consortium proposing a takeover of West Ham is preparing an improved offer for the club after its opening bid of £350m was rejected last month.

            David Gold and David Sullivan, who bought the club in 2010, have seen their standing with supporters plummet since the move to the London Stadium in 2016 and tensions were further inflamed following Grady Diangana’s £18m sale to West Brom this month.

        Sullivan insists he does not want to sell up completely for the time being but is ready to flog a minority stake.

        The consortium is now considering increasing its offer to buy the club but it is serious about striking a deal.West Ham have attracted buyers before  and London stadium sources have questioned the strength of the group’s interest.

        But the American consortium want nothing less than a  51 per cent share so they can take charge of key decision making.</p></div>

					<p>Roy Hodgson’s men were once again indebted to Wilfried Zaha, arguably their most valuable player, whose future at his boyhood club has been up in the air over the summer.

                        The 27-year-old Ivorian winger broke the deadlock inside the opening 15 minutes, subsequently registering his 50th league goal for the Eagles and, despite Southampton finishing with six efforts on goal and forcing Vicente Guaita to produce a spectacular save to deny Danny Ings in stoppage time, all three points would remain in south London which could prove to be valuable in the long run.
                        Southampton knew exactly what to expect heading into this game. Palace and expansive football don’t exactly go hand-in-hand. And they were true to form, only completing 120 passes across 90 minutes, the fewest mustered in a Premier League win since December 2018 when Hodgson’s men inflicted a surprise defeat on Manchester City (119 passes). This preferred style is undoubtedly a risk, and places unnecessary pressure on their defence. </p>
