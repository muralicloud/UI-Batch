          Every student completes a capstone project before graduating. This
          capstone demonstrates the knowledge and skills that you've gained
          while at CSUMB. It's a chance to show future employers and grad
          schools everything you're capable of - that you've got a degree and
          you know how to use it.

          Honestly I doubt my school is known for anything specific. It's
          relatively new; established in 1994. However, most people would say
          that CSUMB is a small university, almost that of a high school. What
          surprised me most of my school is that everyone is so friendly and
          most tend get close to each other. In addition, the majority of
          classes consist of sizes in which teachers can get to know their
          students on a personal level.

          We really don't have any traditions. We are still a really new school.
          There is Greek Fest though that happens every year. It is a big dance
          where people wear togas and the Sororities and Fraternities do their
          strolls.
